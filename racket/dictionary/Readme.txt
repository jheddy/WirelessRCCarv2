Files generated with = http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/tools/lmtool-new.html

it takes as input a list of sentences each in it own line and returns to you the files
 with the language model and the pronounciation dictionary files and other files I am not using.

My input file looked like this :

go 
left
right
stop

So that after I pass the language model and speech recognition files to pocket sphinx it easily recognizes
the words when I say them.
